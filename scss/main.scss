/*
 * main.scss
 *
 * This is the main entry point for importing all the SCSS partials. It ensures that all the necessary 
 * styles (variables, mixins, layout, utilities, and sections) are brought together in one place, 
 * keeping the project modular and organized.
 * 
 * SCSS Files:
 * - Variables: Ensures consistent theming across the project.
 * - Mixins: Reusable blocks of CSS for common styling patterns.
 * - Layout: Organizes padding and margin classes.
 * - Utilities: Provides reusable utility classes.
 * - Sections: Defines specific styles for individual page sections.
